# Understanding the "Red, green, refactor" method.

###The red, green and refactor is a three step process:

__1)__ *Write a failing test* - have a well enough understanding so you can write a test for what you expect and remember that the first test you write should always fail. This is where the word "red" comes from.

__2)__ *Make the failing test pass* - for this you must write the absolute bare minimum to make the test pass. Remember, all your existing tests should also still be passing. This second step referred to as the "green" step.

__3)__ *Refactor the code you wrote* - if there's any way you can simplify the code you have written to make it more readeable then this is your time.

##Note

Let's remember that writing code is not about how complex one can make it but more about how readable it is. Ask yourself, if someone just came in to the team and had a look at your code could they easily and quickly understand it?
